   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add-new-models
   npx prisma generate
   npm run seed
   ```

3. **Additional Features (Optional):**
   - Reports and analytics
   - Data export functionality
   - Bulk data entry

## INTEGRATION NOTES

- **No disruption** to existing application functionality
- New features are completely separate from existing grievance system
- Existing users and roles remain unchanged
- All new routes are protected and isolated

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

- All API routes require authentication
- Role-based access control implemented
- Input validation on both client and server
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The existing application functionality remains intact while adding the new grievance capture and government project management capabilities for Back Officers.
